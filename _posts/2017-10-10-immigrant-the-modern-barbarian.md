title: "'Immigrant': the Modern 'Barbarian'"
---
Immigration has always been a contentious issue, where two sides have vastly different views on how the US should handle its borders. 
In the start, the US had almost open borders, allowing anyone who could physically come to our country access to our opportunity. 
In the 1880s however immigrants were perceived to hurt the economy, and Congress passed laws limiting immigration and taxing immigrants. 
Among these was the "Chinese Exclusion Act," which attempted to reduce the influx of Chinese laborers. 
A similar series of laws was passed in the 1910s, as immigration soared in the face of an imminent war. 
These laws required more rigorous health and literacy tests, which benefited richer regions and classes.

When look at through this lens, the word "immigrant" starts looking like the old Grecian and Roman use of the word "barbarian." 
As we discussed in class, both used the word to refer to those that were outside what they considered 'the civilized world.' 
They viewed others that used different languages and had different cultures as beneath them, and themselves as the best race and culture.
 
When it comes to history, we freely admit the racial and classist tones of our words and our laws. The entire first paragraph was paraphrased from [the USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov/history-and-genealogy/our-history/agency-history/agency-history). 
But in modern times, we are far more hesitant to admit racial or religious intents of immigration laws, although they have not changed as much as we'd maybe like to think. 
[Statistics based politics journal FiveThirtyEight](fivethirtyeight.com) featured an article about [Democrat's views immigration](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-werent-always-super-liberal-on-immigration/) 
where it discussed how the two major parties view immigrants and immigration. One particularly striking figure from the piece was a graph about the impact of immigrants on the economy.

Note that the question made no reference to *illegal* immigration. This shows just how much Republicans dislike immigrants and think they are destructive to the economy. 
They believe that immigration will hurt the US, and therfor is something to be avoided as much as possible. This same trend continues in [a recent poll taken by Quinnipiac](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2480) asking 
>Which comes closest to your view about illegal immigrants who are currently living in the United States? 
A) They should be allowed to stay in the United States and to eventually apply for U.S. citizenship. 
B) They should be allowed to remain in the United States, but not be allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship. 
C) They should be required to leave the U.S.

This change of the perception and connotations of the word throws light on the imperialistic nature of Rupublican immigration policy. They view immigrants
in much the same way that the ancient Greek and Romans viewed those outside of *their* empire: as people of lesser status. 
Although they don't use the word "barbarian" anymore, the word immigrant carries much the same connotation to those of certain political views.
This is an inherantly imperialistic view of the world, as it leads to the views that we must either "enlighten" or "stay away from" those percieved as "outsiders."
It reduces those outside of our empire as those who only exist to be conqured or exploited, instead of fellow humans. This is a dangerous trend, and one that I deeply hope changes in the near future.
Until then, we can only try to be aware of the imperialistic trends in the Republican party and its base, and maybe help reverse this trend on a personal level.
