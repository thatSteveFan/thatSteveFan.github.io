    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a student at UC Irvine. I am writing this blog for Humanities 1A: Empire and it's ruins. I am a freshman and I will be updating this blog frequently.</p>
	</br>
	<p>I am a Computer Science major who enjoys programming, with great experience in Threading, Locks and Networking in Java. I also enjoy math, physics and philosophy.</p>
	</br>
	<p>I enjoy playing Dota and programming, as well as playing various other video games.</p>
	</br>
	<p>My political affiliations would be most closely described by the expression "Democratic Socialist," and I philosophically (though not necessarily policy-wise) agree strongly with Bernie Sanders</p>
	</br>
	<p>I am an avid fan of <a href = "http://fivethirtyeight.com/">538 politics</a>, a politics blog headed by Nate Silver, who CNN called 'statistician extraordinaire.' 
	It does a lot of statistical analysis of polls and employs a great deal of code to contextualize and understand polls.</p>
